NAME
    Text::Markdown - Convert Markdown syntax to (X)HTML

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Markdown 'markdown';
        my $html = markdown($text);

        use Text::Markdown 'markdown';
        my $html = markdown( $text, {
            empty_element_suffix => '>',
            tab_width => 2,
        } );

        use Text::Markdown;
        my $m = Text::Markdown->new;
        my $html = $m->markdown($text);

        use Text::Markdown;
        my $m = Text::MultiMarkdown->new(
            empty_element_suffix => '>',
            tab_width => 2,
        );
        my $html = $m->markdown( $text );

DESCRIPTION
    Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
    easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
    is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
    as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

    Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
    specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
    HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
    HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).

SYNTAX
    This module implements the 'original' Markdown markdown syntax from:

        http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

    Note that Text::Markdown ensures that the output always ends with one
    newline. The fact that multiple newlines are collapsed into one makes
    sense, because this is the behavior of HTML towards whitespace. The fact
    that there's always a newline at the end makes sense again, given that
    the output will always be nested in a block-level element (as opposed to
    an inline element). That block element can be a "<p>" (most often), or a
    "<table>".

    Markdown is not interpreted in HTML block-level elements, in order for
    chunks of pasted HTML (e.g. JavaScript widgets, web counters) to not be
    magically (mis)interpreted. For selective processing of Markdown in
    some, but not other, HTML block elements, add a "markdown" attribute to
    the block element and set its value to 1, "on" or "yes":

        <div markdown="1" class="navbar">
        * Home
        * About
        * Contact
        <div>

    The extra "markdown" attribute will be stripped when generating the
    output.

OPTIONS
    Text::Markdown supports a number of options to its processor which
    control the behaviour of the output document.

    These options can be supplied to the constructor, or in a hash within
    individual calls to the "markdown" method. See the SYNOPSIS for examples
    of both styles.

    The options for the processor are:

    empty_element_suffix
        This option controls the end of empty element tags:

            '/>' for XHTML (default)
            '>' for HTML

    tab_width
        Controls indent width in the generated markup. Defaults to 4.

    trust_list_start_value
        If true, ordered lists will use the first number as the starting
        point for numbering. This will let you pick up where you left off by
        writing:

          1. foo
          2. bar

          some paragraph

          3. baz
          6. quux

        (Note that in the above, quux will be numbered 4.)

METHODS
  new
    A simple constructor, see the SYNTAX and OPTIONS sections for more
    information.

  markdown
    The main function as far as the outside world is concerned. See the
    SYNOPSIS for details on use.

  urls
    Returns a reference to a hash with the key being the markdown reference
    and the value being the URL.

    Useful for building scripts which preprocess a list of links before the
    main content. See t/05options.t for an example of this hashref being
    passed back into the markdown method to create links.

OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
    Markdown has been re-implemented in a number of languages, and with a
    number of additions.

    Those that I have found are listed below:

    C - <http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount>
        Discount - Original Markdown, but in C. Fastest implementation
        available, and passes MDTest. Adds its own set of custom features.

    python - <http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/>
        Python Markdown which is mostly compatible with the original, with
        an interesting extension API.

    ruby (maruku) - <http://maruku.rubyforge.org/>
        One of the nicest implementations out there. Builds a parse tree
        internally so very flexible.

    php - <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/>
        A direct port of Markdown.pl, also has a separately maintained
        'extra' version, which adds a number of features that were borrowed
        by MultiMarkdown.

    lua - <http://www.frykholm.se/files/markdown.lua>
        Port to lua. Simple and lightweight (as lua is).

    haskell - <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>
        Pandoc is a more general library, supporting Markdown,
        reStructuredText, LaTeX and more.

    javascript - <http://www.attacklab.net/showdown-gui.html>
        Direct(ish) port of Markdown.pl to JavaScript

    Please include with your report: (1) the example input; (2) the output
    you expected; (3) the output Markdown actually produced.

THIS DISTRIBUTION
    Please note that this distribution is a fork of John Gruber's original
    Markdown project, and it *is not* in any way blessed by him.

    Whilst this code aims to be compatible with the original Markdown.pl
    (and incorporates and passes the Markdown test suite) whilst fixing a
    number of bugs in the original - there may be differences between the
    behaviour of this module and Markdown.pl. If you find any differences
    where you believe Text::Markdown behaves contrary to the Markdown spec,
    please report them as bugs.

    Text::Markdown *does not* extend the markdown dialect in any way from
    that which is documented at daringfireball. If you want additional
    features, you should look at Text::MultiMarkdown.
