This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Text::MultiMarkdown.

1.0.0   2006-08-22T00:00:00
        - first release

1.0.1   2006-10-20T00:00:00
        - include patch from Uwe Voelker to allow setting of options in
          markdown(); also added a test case from Uwe. Thanks, Uwe!
          Also updated changelog references in POD somewhat.

1.0.2   2007-11-24T14:00:00
        - move to Module::Install and clean various things up, mostly to make
          CPANTS happy.

1.0.3   2007-11-24T20:22:00
        - way to keep me accountable, CPANTESTERS! Maybe I shouldn't have
          Test::Pod::Coverage enabled unless it actually checks out. Added some
          fairly useless stubbed METHODS to POD and moved POD around a bit.
          
1.0.4   2008-01-02T02:03:50
        - Refactor so that the processor instance has the same set of        
          persistent options as on the ->markdown method itself.
        - Change all functions to be instance methods, moved a chunk of the 
          global data to the instance. The rest will follow shortly.
        - The test suite now tests a reasonable set of the Markdown and 
          MultiMarkdown syntaxes.
        - All known options and metadata keys have been documented.
        
1.0.5   2008-01-04T18:07:57
        - Add Markdown and MultiMarkdown test suites.
        - Fix a big bug introduced in 1.0.4 in citations
        - Fix footnotes (and other small things) to match the test suite
        
1.0.6   2008-01-06T13:36:00
        - Merge latest Markdown test suite I can find, and make it all pass, 
          pulling in code from Markdown 1.0.2b8. Things fixed:
            - Inline HTML
            - Lists
            - Metadata skipping by leading line breaks
            - 3rd form of links
        - Implement features to suppress id attributes in <img> and <hX> tags 
          to be able to act more like original Markdown - now almost ready to
          steal Text::Markdown (would want to turn off tables / citations and
          bibliography for that)
        - Move almost all the global variables into instance data.
        - Fix unicode issues from CPAN.org's RT#27482
        - Remove call to srand, it's not smart to do this more than once.
        
1.0.7   2008-01-07T16:31:00
        - Encode isn't in core in all perls, add it to Makefile.PL

1.0.8  2008-01-22T19:20:00
        - Do not encode amps or angle brackets in HTML comments + test case. 
        - Do not emit title attribute in <img> tags unless we have contents 
          for it. This was a 'feature' of original Markdown where I've decided 
          to go with what php-markdown does (tests updated).
        - Added php-markdown tests (most/all of the regular tests pass except 
          the email obfu one).
        - Added php-markdown extra tests (all fail).
        - Added python markdown tests (mostly pass, but marked broken).
        - Add a way of stopping inline HTML blocks from suppressing markdown    
          processing. Feature request from #catalyst-dev 

1.0.9  2008-01-22T20:28:00
        - Ship non-broken dist at CPAN (oops, rushing!)

1.0.10 2008-01-23T15:40:00
        - Fix bug with links procesing in HTML blocks.

1.0.11 2008-01-24T00:12:00
        - Fix syntax error in one of the tests. Note to self - just fixing 
          that warning in the test case, then shipping without retesting, NOT 
          SMART!
          
1.0.12 2008-01-??T??:??:??
        - Fix bug in ul/ol formatting when there is no separating block. 
          Fix and test contributed by Kztk Matsuda, thanks!
