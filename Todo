Todo pre 1.0.12:
     . See also: http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch_num=26334&show_patch=Show+Patch
     . Stop test fails against perl 5.10 (aghhh!)
     . Tests for the following features:
       - disable_footnotes
       - disable_bibliography
       - disable_tables
     . Add links to other implementations to docs and expand a bit.

Todo pre 1.0.13:
    . Stop perl shitting itself due to regex backreference when doing listsug
      and fix the list b
      (see t/17ulolreportedonlist.t and Markdown mailing list)
    . More tests in t/15inlinehtmldoesnoturnoffmarkdown.t, I bet turning this 
      feature on breaks things.

Todo pre 1.0.14:
   . Have a look at extra features in 
     http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras and put anything 
     we consider useful on the roadmap.
   . Integrate maruku (ruby port) test cases properly, and go looking for 
     more.
   . Have a look at the php markdown extra tests to see if we want to steal 
     any of those features.
   . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
