Todo pre 1.0.17:
   . Generally sort out the code layout so that not all of the code lives in
     MultiMarkdown.pm (i.e. Text::Markdown should stand on it's own, with 
     Text::MultiMarkdown being a superset).
    . Finish removing copy and paste code.
    . Write unit tests to ensure that the following features which would have 
      bled into Text::Markdown now don't work:
        . Link attributes
        . Header Xrefs
    . If installed interactively, prompt the user if the Markdown.pl and 
      MultiMarkdown.pl scripts should be installed. Make sure these are 
      totally compatible with the 'original' versions.
    . Better test cases for Markdown.pl and MultiMarkdown.pl

Todo pre 1.0.18:
    . Make the merging of MDTest more obvious, and get back to the markdown
      mailing list about which tests a) I pass, b) I think should be added to 
      MDTest.
    . Re-merge Movable Type and Bloxom compatibility, and add tests.
    . Need a dingus, write a small / demo app then ask the catalyst guys to 
      host?

Todo pre 1.0.19:
    . http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33443
    . More tests in t/15inlinehtmldoesnoturnoffmarkdown.t, I bet turning this 
      feature on breaks things.
    . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module.

Todo pre 1.0.20:
    . Stop perl shitting itself due to regex backreference when doing listsug
      and fix the list bug
      (see t/17ulolreportedonlist.t and Markdown mailing list)
      This probably involves the first draught of the new parser...
    . Text::Balanced is the slowest thing ever. 
      The syntax guide looks like this:
        49.4   0.569  0.568    113   0.0050 0.0050  Text::Balanced::_match_tagged
        18.1   0.209  0.791      3   0.0696 0.2637  Text::MultiMarkdown::_HashHTMLBlocks

Todo pre 1.0.21:
   . Have a look at extra features in 
     http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras and put anything 
     we consider useful on the roadmap.
   . Integrate maruku (ruby port) test cases properly, and go looking for 
     more.
   . Have a look at the php markdown extra tests to see if we want to steal 
     any of those features.
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
